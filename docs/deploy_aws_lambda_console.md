# Deploy Imposter to AWS Lambda using the AWS Console

This section describes how to deploy Imposter as an AWS Lambda function using the AWS Console.

> ### Other ways to deploy to Lambda
>
> You can also deploy Imposter as a Lambda function using the [Imposter CLI](deploy_aws_lambda_cli.md), infrastructure as code tools (e.g. Terraform) or a framework such as [Serverless](deploy_aws_lambda_serverless_framework.md).

## Overview

The key steps are:

- you upload the Imposter ZIP file and your configuration files to an S3 bucket
- you create a Lambda function using the ZIP file as the code source
- you set the environment variables of the function to refer to the configuration path in S3
- you access the Lambda function via a Lambda Function URL or Amazon API Gateway

## Prerequisites

You must have an AWS account and permission to deploy Lambda functions, create/write to an S3 bucket, and configure API Gateway.

### Upload configuration to S3 bucket

We are going to store the Imposter configuration files in an S3 bucket. Upload your configuration files to the S3 bucket, under a path such as `config`.

For the purposes of this guide, we will assume you have uploaded the configuration to a bucket named `example-imposter-bucket`, so the full path to the configuration file would be:

```
s3://example-imposter-bucket/config/imposter-config.yaml
```

You may add related files here, such as response files, specifications etc.

```
s3://example-imposter-bucket/config/openapi-spec.yaml
s3://example-imposter-bucket/config/response.json
...
```

## Deployment steps

This method uses the AWS Web Console to create a Lambda function, and enables you to call it using the Lambda Function URL.

### Step 1: Upload Imposter to an S3 bucket

The Imposter engine for AWS Lambda is packaged as a ZIP file. You should upload this file to an S3 bucket, from where it will be referenced by your Lambda function.

Open the [AWS S3 Console](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home). Upload the `imposter-awslambda.zip` file from the [Releases page](https://github.com/outofcoffee/imposter/releases/latest) to an S3 bucket.

For the purposes of this guide, we will assume you have uploaded the ZIP file to a bucket named `example-imposter-bucket`, so the full path to the file would be:

```
s3://example-imposter-bucket/imposter-awslambda.zip
```

### Step 2: Create your Lambda function

Open the [AWS Lambda Console](https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home). Create a new function using the file you uploaded to S3 as the code source.

*Important:* Set the following:

- runtime: `Java 11`
- architecture: `x86_64` or `arm64`

### Step 3: Set handler

Under **Runtime settings** set the handler to: `io.gatehill.imposter.awslambda.HandlerV2`

### Step 4: Set environment variables

Under **Configuration**, add the following environment variable:

```
IMPOSTER_S3_CONFIG_URL="s3://example-imposter-bucket/config/"
```

Set the environment variable to point to the path holding the configuration files:

> Note: this is not the path to the YAML _file_ - it is the directory ('prefix') under which the file exists in the bucket.

*Important:* Ensure the Lambda execution role has permission to access the S3 bucket containing your configuration.

See [deploy/example/bucket-policy.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/outofcoffee/imposter/main/distro/awslambda/deploy/example/bucket-policy.json) for an example IAM role.

### Step 5: Enable function URL

Under **Configuration**, enable the 'Function URL' option - this will create an HTTPS endpoint for you to access Imposter.

![Lambda function URL](./images/lambda_url.png)

Once you have created it, you should see the Function URL:

![Lambda web console](./images/lambda.png)

### Step 6: Test the function

If all has gone well, you should be able to reach your Lambda function using the Function URL:

```shell
$ curl https://<Lambda Function URL>/system/status

{ "status": "ok" }
```
