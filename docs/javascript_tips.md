# JavaScript tips and tricks

## Background

This section provides additional tips and tricks when using JavaScript as the scripting language for your mocks. It builds on the [Scripting](./scripting.md) documentation. If you are new to Imposter scripting, it's best to start there.

## Multi-file JavaScript scripts

Sometimes you may want to split your JavaScript scripts into multiple files for better organisation. You can do this by using a bundler like Webpack or Browserify to bundle your scripts into a single file.

See [imposter-js-types](https://github.com/imposter-project/imposter-js-types) for how to do this.

Check out the [samples](https://github.com/imposter-project/imposter-js-types/tree/main/samples) directory for a JavaScript and a TypeScript example project.
