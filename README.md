# Imposter: A scriptable, multipurpose mock server [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/outofcoffee/imposter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/outofcoffee/imposter)

Reliable, scriptable and extensible mock server for general REST APIs,
[OpenAPI](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) (aka Swagger) specifications,
Salesforce and HBase APIs.

## What's it for?

Use Imposter to:

* run standalone mocks in place of real systems
* decouple your integration tests from the cloud/various back-end systems and take control of your dependencies
* quickly set up a temporary API for your mobile/web client teams whilst the real API is being built

Mock responses can use simple static files, or be customised using [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) or [Groovy](http://www.groovy-lang.org/) scripts. Power users can write thier own plugins in a JVM language of their choice.

## Plugins

Imposter uses plugins to control its behaviour and provide specialised mocks:

* **rest** - Mocks RESTful APIs.
* **openapi** - Support for [OpenAPI](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) (aka Swagger) API specifications.
* **sfdc** - Basic Salesforce mock implementation.
* **hbase** - Basic HBase mock implementation.

You can also create your own plugins, using a JVM language of your choice.

## Example

Let's assume your [configuration](docs/configuration.md) is in a folder named `config`.

Docker example:

    docker run -ti -p 8443:8443 \
        -v $(pwd)/config:/opt/imposter/config \
        outofcoffee/imposter-rest

Standalone Java example:

    java -jar distro/build/libs/imposter.jar \
        --plugin com.gatehill.imposter.plugin.rest.RestPluginImpl \
        --configDir ./config

Your mock server is now running!

This example starts a mock server using the simple
[REST plugin](docs/rest_plugin.md), serving responses based on the configuration files
inside the `config` folder. You can hit the URL
[http://localhost:8443/example](http://localhost:8443/example) to see the mock response.
